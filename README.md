Yet another open-source hacker news clone, but geared towards academic research.
Wrote it with the goal of publishing it but realized I do not want to go through the hassle of spamming it around to get it out there. Maybe someone else will find it useful.
The repo features all the stuff needed for deplyoing on amazon AWS EC2.

A screenshot from the website, in memoriam.
